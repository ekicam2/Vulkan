#Fast Intro
##What is this and what is not?
* It's just fast jump in Vulkan api written C-like C++ style.
* It's not production code!
* It's not showing how you should write a good code!
* It's not showing best practieces!
* It does not have to be pretty!
* It has to be useful for me, if it would help someone that's cool but that's not a main goal for this part of this repository!
